# Local-Python-SetUp-Assignment-1

In this activity, we walk you through setting up Python on your local machine.

Although we can write and run Python programs online on systems like Replit, we gain more flexibility over our environment when we have it locally installed. Running code from local files (files stored on your personal computer) is also more like what you would be doing professionally, and will allow you to put your code on GitHub like we have been doing with our JavaScript projects.

Because we already have our computer set up for JavaScript, setting up for Python won't be very difficult. Below, we walk you through the steps for installing Python, depending on whether you are using a Mac, PC, or Linux machine. We won't need to install any extra IDE because we already have VSCode installed.
